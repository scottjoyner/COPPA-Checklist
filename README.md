# COPPA 6 Step Compliance Checklist

### Step 1: Determine if Your Company is a Website or Online Service that Collects Personal Information from Kids Under 13.
> Where personal information has been defined as any of the following
- [ ] full name;
- [ ] home or other physical address, including street name and city or town;
- [ ] online contact information like an email address or other identifier that permits someone to contact a person directly — for example, an IM identifier, VoIP identifier, or video chat identifier;
- [ ] screen name or user name where it functions as online contact information;
- [ ] telephone number;
- [ ] Social Security number;
- [ ] a persistent identifier that can be used to recognize a user over time and across different sites, including a cookie number, an IP address, a processor or device serial number, or a unique device identifier;
- [ ] a photo, video, or audio file containing a child’s image or voice;
- [ ] geolocation information sufficient to identify a street name and city or town; or
- [ ] other information about the child or parent that is collected from the child and is combined with one of these identifiers.
> Where data collection can be seen as any of the following
- [ ] request, prompt, or encourage the submission of information, even if it’s optional;
- [ ] let information be made publicly available (for example, with an open chat or posting function) unless you take reasonable measures to delete all or virtually all personal information before postings are public and delete all information from your records; or
- [ ] passively track a child online.
### Step 2: Post a Privacy Policy that Complies with COPPA.
> To comply with COPPA, your privacy policy should be clear and easy to read. It must contain the following
- [ ] A list of all operators collecting personal information.
  - [ ] the types of personal information collected from children (for example, name, address, email address, hobbies, etc.);
  - [ ] how the personal information is collected — directly from the child or passively, say, through cookies;
  - [ ] how the personal information will be used (for example, for marketing to the child, notifying contest winners, or allowing the child to make information publicly available through a chat room); and
  - [ ] whether you disclose personal information collected from kids to third parties. If you do, your privacy policy must list the types of businesses you disclose information to (for example, ad networks) and how they use the information.
- [ ] A description of the personal information collected and how it’s used.
- [ ] A description of parental rights.
  - [ ] that you won’t require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity;
  - [ ] that they can review their child’s personal information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child’s information;
  - [ ] that they can agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties unless that’s part of the service (for example, social networking); and
  - [ ] the procedures to follow to exercise their rights.

### Step 3: Notify Parents Directly Before Collecting Personal Information from Their Kids. [See Exceptions](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-six-step-compliance#chart)
### Step 4: Get Parents’ Verifiable Consent Before Collecting Personal Information from Their Kids.
### Step 5: Honor Parents’ Ongoing Rights with Respect to Personal Information Collected from Their Kids.
### Step 6: Implement Reasonable Procedures to Protect the Security of Kids’ Personal Information.
